# CLAUDE.md

## 🚀 BOILERPLATE NOTICE

**This is a boilerplate repository for getting started with Claude Code
projects.** **UPDATE CLAUDE.md TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL PROJECT NAME AND
DESCRIPTION, ONCE YOU START WORKING ON THE PROJECT.**

---

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - Build production application
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run test` - Run Playwright end-to-end tests

## Framework and Library Recommendations

For this web application project, use the following technologies:

- Next.js - React framework with App Router
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling framework
- shadcn/ui - Component library (using shadcn@latest CLI)
- Supabase - Backend and authentication
- Zod - Input validation
- React Hook Form - Form handling
- React Query - Data fetching and caching
- motion - Animation library (formerly framer-motion)
- polar.sh - Payment processing (see
  https://docs.polar.sh/integrate/sdk/adapters/nextjs for setup)
- Playwright - End-to-end testing

**ALWAYS** use TypeScript with strict type checking over JavaScript. **NEVER**
create projects from scratch - always use framework CLIs to scaffold projects.

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 application using the App Router with:

- Framework: Next.js 15 with React 19
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4 with custom CSS variables
- UI Components: shadcn/ui components in "new-york" style with Radix primitives
- Testing: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Fonts: Geist Sans and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- Charts: Recharts for data visualization
- Theme: next-themes for dark/light mode support
- Notifications: Sonner for toast notifications
- Backend: Supabase integration configured
- Forms: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Additional Libraries: Embla Carousel, Command Menu (cmdk), Date handling
  (date-fns), motion (animations)

### Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/ui/` - Complete shadcn/ui component library including accordion,
  alert-dialog, avatar, badge, breadcrumb, button, calendar, card, carousel,
  checkbox, collapsible, command, context-menu, dialog, drawer, dropdown-menu,
  form, hover-card, input, input-otp, label, menubar, navigation-menu,
  pagination, popover, progress, radio-group, resizable, scroll-area, select,
  separator, sheet, sidebar, skeleton, slider, sonner, switch, table, tabs,
  textarea, toggle, tooltip, and more
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (e.g., `use-mobile.ts` for responsive design)
- `lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions including Tailwind class merging
- `supabase/` - Supabase configuration and setup
- `tests/` - Playwright test files
- `public/` - Static assets

### shadcn/ui Configuration

Components are configured with:

- Style: "new-york"
- Base color: neutral
- CSS variables enabled
- Icon library: lucide-react
- Path aliases: `@/components`, `@/lib/utils`, etc.

### Playwright Configuration

- Tests run against all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Base URL: http://localhost:3000
- Auto-starts dev server if not running, reuses existing server if available
- 2-minute timeout for server startup

## Environment Variables

When working with environment variables in Next.js:

- **Server-side only**: Use standard naming (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_SECRET`)
- **Client-side access**: **MUST** prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (e.g.,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
- Environment variables without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are **NOT** available
  in the browser
- **NEVER** expose sensitive data (API keys, secrets) with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Store environment variables in `.env.local` for local development
- Use `.env.example` to document required environment variables

## Validation Strategy

**ALWAYS** work iteratively and validate your work after finishing each task by
following these steps in order:

### Quick Validation Steps (run for each task)

1. **Linting**: `npm run lint` - Check for syntax and style issues
2. **Type checking**: `npm run typecheck` - Ensure TypeScript correctness
3. **Specific tests**: Run only relevant Playwright tests for changed
   functionality. If you implemented new functionality, write tests for it and
   run them.

### Complete Validation (run only after all tasks are complete)

4. **Build**: `npm run build` - Full production build verification
5. **Complete test suite**: `npm run test` - All Playwright end-to-end tests

### Testing Guidelines

- **ALWAYS** write tests for new functionality - this is required for validation
- Write realistic e2e tests from a user perspective focusing on actual
  interactions
- **NEVER** write trivial tests that only assert component visibility
- Focus on meaningful user workflows and business logic
- If existing tests fail that are not part of the current task, **STOP** and ask
  for guidance
- Do NOT auto-fix unrelated test failures
- If tests fail without a clear reason, use playwright mcp to debug the test in
  a real browser

# General

- Don't add any components that are not part of the shadcn library to
  components/ui
- If you add images from the internet, make sure that the domain is allowed in
  remotePatterns in next.config.ts
